	<h1 id="top">Setting</h1>

	<p>The setting is important- It'll influence your character in so many ways!  You may know you want a princess, but is she from the middle ages? The present?  The future?  An entirely different planet?  Because of that setting, is she talking with a southern drawl?  Does she ever slip into another language?  What time of year is it?  Will she need a coat?  And can she hide a dagger in there?  Are they at war?</p>

<p>Now that I've asked so many questions, it's time for you to make some decisions.  Below, I've listed out a few of the common points that you'll need to consider, but there are infinite possibilities and choices to make.  Choose what feels right for the story that <b>YOU</b> want to tell.</p>

<blockquote>Fall, Winter, Summer, Spring?  Something in between?  Are their seasons different from ours?  Is it always rainy and spring or always summer and hot?</blockquote>

<blockquote> Fun fact, in German the word for history and story are the same.  Coincidence?  I think not! History is just the story of our world after all.  Why am I bringing this up here? Because now is the time to look through history and see how it could work with the world and characters that you're creating.  There is so much to be *ahem* taken from the stories of our world.  See what I did there? </blockquote>

<blockquote> Is your story based in the past?  Well, then wearing pants is probably scandalous for that princess you are writting about.  Back then the world wasn't so forward thinking, women had a lot harder time moving forward.  Legs would get tangled in the skirts, you know?  Which works out way better for your story, because skirts are so much easier to hide the dagger that you couldn't fit into your coat. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Is your story based off of the present?  What things do we know?  What is our culture like?  Include that in your story.  If your story is based in the future, what things have we learned?  What is different?  The world has a lot of examples that we can lean on to help create the environment for our characters.</blockquote><br>

<blockquote> Look at a world map and use the stigmas you associate with each region.  Is she from someplace with a thick accent?  Is she from somewhere mountainous- and therefore able to track?  An island and able to fish? Yes, the world is obsessed with not being racist or basing our opinions off of these stigmas, but stigmas are there for a reason.  Our environment rubs off on us a lot.  Don't be afraid to mix and match those stigmas either.  This story is yours. </blockquote>
